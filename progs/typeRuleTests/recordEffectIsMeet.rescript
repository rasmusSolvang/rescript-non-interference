-- cabal run exes progs/typeRuleTests/RecordEffectIsMeet.rescript
-- Tests that the effect of a record expression is the (âŠ“) of field effects.
-- What is done is the following: A record with two fields are created, hence l1: Low@Low, l2:High@High
-- Then next, in a high security context the record field with Low@Low is called. 
-- This should then be disallowed because the effect of the record is low, thus disallowing the let binding.
